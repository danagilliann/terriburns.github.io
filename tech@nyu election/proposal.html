			A NOTE ABOUT THE ELECTION <br><br>

We [Terri, Abhi, Freia and Katy] are excited to be running to lead this club. We&#39;re excited to be working with and not against each other. Whatever the outcome of this election, we&#39;re excited to combine visions and balance priorities for the best possible outcome for Tech@NYU. </font><br><br>


TERRI AND FREIA&#39;S PROPOSAL<br><br>


<i>VISION AND GOALS FOR THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR</i><br><br>

<p1>
Introduce a Vice President and streamline internal processes:  Make event planning a much smoother process by adding a Vice President who will directly check in with leads, allowing the President to adhere to broader-scope internal responsibilities.
</p1><br><br> 

<p2>Rationale:</p2> This past year, Ethan was a point of accountability for all team leads in addition to broader scope issues. Moving forward, we want to split both roles between President and Vice President, as this has proven to be a great responsibility and allocation can lead to better execution.<br><br>

<p3>How:</p3> Terri and Freia run for President and Vice-President!<br><br>

<p1>Participating in more outreach initiatives within the greater NYC tech community: Participate by co-planning, generally supporting, or sending volunteers in order to have a bigger impact on the internal and external Tech@NYU community.  </p1><br><br>

<p2>Rationale:</p2> Tech@NYU already has a tangible impact on the NYU/NYC community. In order to ensure our continued impact as well as expand it, we&#39;d like to support outreach, diversity, and other similar technology initiatives around the city. Tech@NYU has a relatively large following in addition to being a club that supports of breadth of technology facets. As such, we&#39;re in a great position to support initiatives beyond our own.<br><br>

<p3>How:</p3> Regularly volunteering at, promoting, and exploring different technology events round the city, including more non-profit tech events in our newsletter, and sharing about events via social media.  We want to be a point of support for one another, and other groups in the city throughout this process. Note that these events will not replace our regular initiatives, and the expectation is not to have executive board members commit infinitely more hours to additional events. Instead, we hope to produce more collaborations with external companies, and execute some of our community development time through outreach. (For example, hosting a Design Days event in partnership with Girls Who Code, or doing a community development event where our team volunteers with Coalition for Queens and grabs dinner afterward.)<br><br>

<p1>Building internal community.</p1><br><br>

<p2>Rationale:</p2> The better we know and respect each other, the easier it is to work together.<br><br>

<p3>How:</p3> More events together, more late-night After Hours, ever-better retreats, coffee chats, committing to hosting exclusive e-board events for the sole purpose of hanging out, not doing Tech@NYU related stuff. This can be as informal as facilitating dinners after eboard meetings and as structured as a planned retreat. <u>Most importantly, we want to have regular conversations with the executive board about how we can strengthen this area of our board. Notably, building internal community is something we&#39;ve been trying to do for years now, and moving forward regular feedback from the board can help make this actually happen. </u><br><br>

<p1>Continuing to integrate prioritize infrastructure/API. This year the infrastructure team has spent a lot of time building the API as a tool for our board. Moving forward, we want to implement its use more regularly for all executive board members for potential ease and clarity in event planning.</p1><br><br>

<p2>Rationale:</p2> Few executive board members outside of the infrastructure team are familiar with the API. The purpose of the API is to actually use it. <u>The API does a lot-- it serves to document processes, streaming things we do frequently like reach out to companies to book rooms, automation, and more.</u><br><br>

<p3>How:</p3> Meeting with infrastructure team to decide how exactly to move forward.  Also allotting time at events, After Hours, and potentially weekly meeting(s) to teach the rest of the board how to use it.<br><br>


<i>WHY WE NEED PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT</i><br><br>
Tech@NYU has grown significantly and we need more than one person of higher authority to balance this growth:<br><br>

<p1>Areas of Growth</p1><br>
-Startup Week, 500+ attendees<br>
-size of board almost double what it was a year ago + introduction of team leads. <u>(Note that for onboarding next year, we hope to keep the size of the board roughly the same.)</u><br>
- creation  of infrastructure and community teams<br>
-general increased attendance of events<br>
-general increased notice throughout campus<br><br>

<p1>Tech@NYU needs to better streamline its internal processes:</p1><br>
While Tech@NYU hosts strong events regularly, we want to restructure the internal system for making these events happen.  By having both a President and Vice President, there can be a stronger balance of power, more consistent checks and balances, and quicker turnaround time to resolve issues and concerns. Additionally, team leads can be held more accountable for their respective leadership roles.<br><br>

<i>ROLES OF EACH:</i><br><br>
<p2>TERRI (PRESIDENT)</p2><br><br>
Setting and amending priorities.  This includes priorities club-wide (changing initiatives, rethinking frequency, diversifying events, etc), and also initiative-specific priorities.  Each initiative has different needs, members, and processes, which should continuously be addressed. <br><br>
Oversee team leads in a general sense, be a support to Freia (see below).<br><br>
Forming &#39;relationships.&#39; Seeking opportunities for Tech@NYU to get more involved in the greater NYC (and beyond) technology scene, connecting Tech@NYU with other NYU clubs for co-sponsorship, connecting Tech@NYU more strongly with the administration, connecting Tech@NYU with our advisors, connecting internal executive board members with one another.<br><br>
Running e-board meetings efficiently, productively, and smoothly each week. 
Public face. Speaking at events and such.<br><br>
Shaping the topics of events and groups we collaborate with. Will have an emphasis on events and partnerships related to technical (programming) skills, design, entrepreneurship, startups, diversity initiatives, and the interests of the executive-board.<br><br>
<p2>FREIA (VICE-PRESIDENT)</p2><br><br>
Making sure everything is running smoothly. At the beginning of the week, quick checking with leads on upcoming events to make sure they&#39;re all good with marketing, location, etc. Providing clarity as to avoid miscommunication.<br><br>
Making sure the team is properly documenting, utilizing our network well, and overall being more well organized to increase efficiency. Documentation is important, and as such the VP (with help/support from Terri) will facilitate debrief sessions after major events and with team leads who can write down &#39;lessons learned&#39; and &#39;tips to keep in mind&#39; for records. This will also help with team transition periods.<br><br>
Ensuring that our team builds positive relationships with NYU in terms of CSALS, ASSBAC, etc. Working with the treasurer and experienced executive board members in this regard (katy, abhi ash) to make sure this is done effectively. <br><br>
Assisting Terri with all of the above to make sure our team runs well internally.<br><br>
<p2>BOTH</p2><br><br>
Keeping team members happy, listening to feedback, being points of contact, crisis aversion. <u>Note that we are both points of contact here. As President and Vice-President we will be working very closely with one another and sharing information, but either of us can be reached to address questions or concerns.</u> <br><br>
Responding to incoming partnership requests<br><br>
Miscellaneous <br><br>
Infrastructure/API<br><br>
Making team decisions. Moving forward, we&#39;d like to maintain a democratic, discussion-based, and loose voting system for making team decisions.  In the interest of time (at meetings and within the school year), certain decisions will ultimately be made by the President and Vice-President. These decisions may include (but are not necessarily limited to) recruiting, partnership requests, and food choices.<br><br><br>

<i>DREAM TEAM? HERE&#39;S WHY:</i><br>
We&#39;re not too focused on intense politics, world class branding, or changing the world. We have and will execute high quality events for an increasingly diverse and inclusive community of student technologists. We do what we can, we do it increasingly better, and we have fun doing it. No frills.<br><br>
We&#39;re committed to a balance of an efficient, high functioning club thatâ€™s also not too corporate and loads of fun.<br><br>
We get along personally and professionally. Really well. Like really well.<br><br>

<i>HOW TECH@NYU IS UNIQUE, TL;DR, HOW WE MOVE FORWARD</i><br><br>
As it stands, we are each proud of the events our team puts on, as they are generally well-executed and relatively well-attended. Our goals therefore are more focused on the internal execution of our events, making sure they run smoothly, that we are areas of support for the team, and that the events continue to run well and get even better. Personally (regardless of the outcome of this election)Terri would like to commit more time to hacking at After Hours, and Freia promises to to stop lurking on the tech@nyu github and start (literally) committing :) <br><br>

We&#39;re lucky because we&#39;re  not an overly  specialized club. We arenâ€™t limited to just one area, technology is increasingly ubiquitous. We like to explore the multiple facets of technology including design, entrepreneurship, coding/engineering, VC, etc. Moving forward, we also want to make sure we do it in a wider context. In some cases that means hosting events, and in others that simply means supporting initiatives targeted towards children, underrepresented groups in tech, and across disciplines such as art, history, and literature. Moving forward, we want to capitalize more on the breadth of our club to impact as many lives as possible.<br><br>


<u>xoxo you guys are the best</u>
