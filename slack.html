      <h1>On my love for Slack, and it's potential for the future</h1>
      <h2>I love Slack. It's changed the way I communicate with Internet friends, IRL friends, coworkers, and fellow students. As I think about the kind of impact I hope the technology world can have on people's lives, I to see the tangible impact Slack has on improving day to day interactions with people. Here are some of my thoughts on directions Slack can go in the future to improve lives.</h2>

        <i>About half of the slack groups that I am in consist almost entirely of students.</i><br>

        Very recently a friends of mine from school (NYU) told me that they were using Slack for class discussions. I was really excited to hear this because it was a friend of mine in a non-technical major, and I most of the Slack groups that I am a part of are for technical communitities.

        <br>Slack could really improve communications at schools. In educational systems, turnaround time for events, projects, meetings, classes, etc. are much faster than in professional settings. Similar to Google Apps for education, schools could really utlize a "Slack for Education" account. This would essentially be a master Slack group with highly-structured and specified admin settings. The channels in the group would be used for creating channels for classes, school events, important announcements, etc. This would be a huge technical feat, and a complex problem to think through, but has the potential to impact the education system in a really powerful way.

      <h3>C H A N N E L S</h3>
        <i>Slack gets cluttered, fast.</i><br>
      <h2>
        The Slack group that I am most active in is for <a href="http://techatnyu">Tech@NYU</a> NYC's largest student technology organization, which I lead. We have periodically had to go on Slack "cleanses," where we wipe out channels that go unused. A small, but potentially really helpful suggestion, which is that if a Slack channel is innactive for ~2 weeks or so, Slackbot could automatically message the group asking if it should be archived. (With more options in settings to regulate this rule depending on group.)
      </h2>
      <h3>S L A C K B O T S</h3>
        <i>Slackbots have enhanced my slack experience in almost every channel that I'm in.</i><br>
      <h2>
        Slack should encourage users (specifically non-technical users) to make Slackbots! Bots are so useful because they can be impleneted to do pretty much anything necessary in a specific group.
